### Destructor

For a C++ class, a *destructor* is a special method that handles object destruction, generally focused on preventing memory leaks. Class destructors donâ€™t take arguments as input and their names are always preceded by a tilde `~`.

```
City::~City() {
 
  // Any final cleanup
 
}
```

### Class Members

A class is comprised of class members:

- *Attributes*, also known as member data, consist of information about an instance of the class.
- *Methods*, also known as member functions, are functions that can be used with an instance of the class.

```
class City {
 
  // Attribute
  int population;
 
public:
  // Method
  void add_resident() {
    population++;
  }
 
};
```

### Constructor

For a C++ class, a *constructor* is a special kind of method that enables control regarding how the objects of a class should be created. Different class constructors can be specified for the same class, but each constructor signature must be unique.

```
#include "city.hpp"
 
class City {
 
  std::string name;
  int population;
 
public:
  City(std::string new_name, int new_pop);
 
};
```

### Objects

In C++, an *object* is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and functionality pertaining to that data.

```
City nyc;
```

### Access Control Operators

C++ classes have access control operators that designate the scope of class members:

- `public`
- `private`

`public` members are accessible everywhere; `private` members can only be accessed from within the same instance of the class or from friends classes.

```
class City {
 
  int population; 
 
public:
  void add_resident() { 
    population++;
  }
 
private:
  bool is_capital;
 
};
```

### Class

A C++ class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates information and behavior about an object. It serves as a blueprint for future inherited classes.

```
class Person {
 
};
```
