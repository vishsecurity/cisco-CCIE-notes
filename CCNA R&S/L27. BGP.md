BGP Border Gateway Protocol
**CCNA needs to know - eBGP (External Border Gateway Protocol) configuration between [A] Enterprise Server and [B]ISP Server using single internet link
**CCNA: 3 types of eBGP connections
1) Dual Homed connection - 2 connections between [A] and [B]
2) Single Multihomed connection - 1 connection [A] to [B]1 and 1 connection [A] to [B]2
3) Dual Multihomed connection - 2 connections [A] to [B]1 and 2 connections [A] to [B]2

BGP Border Gateway Protocols vs IGP Interior Gateway Protocols
> IGP (within AS) = OSPF, EIGRP
> BGP (between AS) = 
- BGP is the only protocol used on the internet
- BGP runs the internet
- BGP chooses best routes based on metric/criteria 
- BGP needs to converge (when there is a change - add/remove/change/replace)
- BGP routing tables are huge and increasing (all routes on the internet) 
**BGP relationship is not automatic, manual configuration is required on both routers. BGP runs on Layer 7, therefore not on an interface. Whereas IGP such as EIGRP, IGP runs on Layer 3/4 and therefore are configured automatically
- BGP (admin distance) = 200
- OSPF (admin distance) = 110

iBGP vs eBGP
- iBGP - inside same AS but still routers on the internet
- iBGP - advertise itself with Loopack
- eBGP - different AS
- eBGP - advertise itself with the physical connected interface

BGP Neighbor states
1) Idle
- No connection to neighbor (neighbor shutdown)
2) Connect
- TCP connection has been attempted, but hasn't been completed
3) Active (Not working!)
- TCP connection has been completed, no BGP messages have been sent
4) Opensent 
- TCP connection exists, router is trying to create connection to neighboring device
5) Openconfirm
- TCP connection exists, local router had receive a message back from neighboring router
6) Established
- Both router and neighboring router has agreed to form relationship. Now they can exchange messages with each other

> **Just because BGP is setup, does not mean routes are automatically advertised, it must be redistribute it or manually advertise
> **Router ID is its loopback address (automatically)
> *Use loopbacks for Router IP Address

> R1 17.17.17.1/32 loopback <-> R2 17.17.17.2/32 loopback

> R1(config-router)#neighbor 17.17.17.2 remote-as 17
> R1(config-router)#neighbor 17.17.17.2 update-source loopback 0 [when R1 wants to send to 17.17.17.2, it uses its loopback 0 as the source - this way, 17.17.17.2 expects R1's loopback address to send traffic to 17.17.17.2 and not a random interface] 
> OSPF is used for internal routers, they must be enabled
> R1(config-router)#router ospf 1
> R1(config-router)#network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0

==Force 1-BGP path over another==

***BGP - TLDR***
*Internal BGP, not on CCNA exam
1) Both Internal and External BGP
- Uses remote-as "neighbor y.y.y.y remote-as 17"
- Advertise its networks in exact subnet mask
- When selecting router bgp XX, XX refers to its own bgp 
2) Internal BGP - in addition to (1)
- uses OSPF/routing protocols interfaces connecting 2 internal routers
- uses Loopback as its source "neighbor x.x.x.x update-source loopback 0"
3) Administrative Distances
eBGP - 20
iBGP - 200
4) eBGP, iBGP
- eBGP runs outside of AS (different AS #)
- iBGP runs within AS (same AS #)
5) Quick ex. R3 15.1.1.1 /24 <-> R4 15.1.1.2 /24
R3(config)# router bgp 65002
R3(config-router)#neighbor 15.1.1.2 remote-as 65002
R3(config-router)#network 15.1.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0
R4(config)# router bgp 65002
R4(config-router)#neighbor 15.1.1.1 remote-as 65002
