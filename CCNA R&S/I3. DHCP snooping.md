DHCP Snooping
**Layer 2 security feature in an ethernet switch environment
'bootp'
- Sets Trusted/Untrusted ports
- Prevent Rogue DHCP servers, man-in-the-middle attacks
- All ports are untrusted by default, you have to explicit a specific port as trusted for that port for DHCP Snooping to allow the DHCP server on that port. If it is untrusted, the untrusted port will not be able to receive DHCP messages
**Switch will build a DHCP Snooping Binding Database (MAC Address, IP Address, VLAN of host), this Database can be leverage by other security features

==Show DHCP leases==
R1#show ip dhcp binding
==Enable DNS on router==
R1#conf t
R1(config)#ip dns server
R1(config)#ip domain-lookup

Man-in-the-middle
> Setup rogue DHCP server and provide the IP to the user
> User -> Rogue DHCP server -> Real Gateway
1) ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.1.254 (rogue DHCP server)
2) enable NAT (ex. if user wants to to get their router name MyRouter, then we can set 2a)
2a) rougeRouter(config)#ip host MyRouter 10.1.2.254 (MyRouter's own gateway - translating the name to an IP address)

==Enable DHCP Snooping on switch==
Switch1#conf t
Swtich1(config)#ip dhcp snooping lan 1 [enabled on VLAN1]
Swtich1(config)#ip dhcp snooping [enabled globally]
==Enable trusted ports (because default, all untrusted)==
> Assume g0/0 on switch is DHCP server
> Router1#conf t
> Router1(config)#interface g0/0
> Router1(config-if)#ip dhcp snopping trust
