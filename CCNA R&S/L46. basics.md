Network Protocol
- Language that governs communication between networking devices

Cost of route
- The number of routes (jumps) it takes to go from one interface to another

SOHO 
- Small office & Home office

tracert 
- tracert is amount of hops to destination

Logical topology
- Path of how data is transferred between devices

Physical topology
- Physical arrangement of a network (cables, devices)

DNS Domain Name System

Speed (bits per second)
(bytes = 8 bits)

Uptime vs Availability
- Uptime = Number of minutes / Total number of minutes in a year [525600]
- Availability = ((Total number of minutes in a year-Downtime in minutes)/(Total number of minutes in a year ))* 100


Bits (0,1)
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Hexadecimal (0-F)
0,1,2,...,9,A,B,...,F
0,1,2,...,9,10 (1010),11,...,15 (1111)
ex. 128 = 1000 0000 = 8 0 or 80 (Hexadecimal)
ex. 240 = 1111 0000 = 15 0 or F0 (Hexadecimal)

ipconfig /all | more
arp -a
telnet (ip)

Change MAC address of computer (NIC -> Configure -> Network Address)

*Ping requires ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol

RFC1918 Addresses
- Private address 10.1.1.1

IP Characteristics
- Layer 3 or network layer protocol
- Connectionless, no sessions formed. TCP on the other hand is connection oriented
- packets treated independently of other packets (packets can take different paths to get to destination)
	-> these packets go through "Routing Protocol" where it determines the bestpath from A to B (bandwidth, hopcount, load balancing)
- NO guranteed delivery or data loss recovery (corruption), IP uses "best effort delivery", again TCP will be needed if guranteed is requried

Recap IP:
- no builtin sessions
- no builtin retransmission
- TCP is needed to handle dropped, corrupted, and misdirected packets. IP relies on higher level protocol for those requriements

Before TCP can be established and any data transmitted, 3-way handshake
(Transmitter) SYN -> (Receiver)
(Transmitter) <- SYN ACK (Receiver)
(Transmitter) -> ACK (Receiver)


Basic Communication:
- CSMA/CD Carrier Sense Multiple Access Colision Detection
- Broadcast is not supported on IPv6
- Broadcast vs Multicast - multicast is a selected group of broadcast



When to use Straight Through and Cross Over?
- Straight Through: router-switch, pc-switch, pc-bridge, pc-hub
- Cross Over: switch-switch, pc-pc, hub-hub, router-router, bridge-switch, pc-server, hub-switch

MDI Media Dependent Interface
- Nowadys Auto MDI/MDIX made cross over cables obsolete - auto detect cable type
- PC, routers uses MDI
- Switches and Hub uses MDIX

MAC Address
- 48 bits (24 bits to OUI + 24 bits to Station Address)
- OUI = Organizational Identifier - identifies vendor
- Station address should be unique (can be changed in software) but it is burnt into NIC physically

MAC OUI 
- Last bit in the 1st Octet is 0 (unicast) or 1 (multicast)
- 2nd last bit in the 1st Octet is 0 (globally unique MAC address) or 1 (administrator has changed this in software)





Router (remote destination)
?How it works?
See Section 111.
*Moral of the story: IP address will remain the same, but each time a Host transverse a router, the source MAC and destination MAC will be rewritten (Layer 2 headers)

Broadcast Domain vs Collision Domain
- Broadcast Domain is the entire network that is attached to a router
- Collision Domains: each device connected to a device is a collision domain, switch connecting to router is its own collision domain, everything attached to a hub is a single collision domain

ARP commands on CMD
- arp -d (deletes arp cache)
- arp -a (shows arp entries)
*Note pinging will usually fail its 1st entry due to ARP cache hasn't been populated during its 1st ping.

Full duplex/Half duplex
- Full duplex is able to send and receive traffic at the same time, in comparison to Hubs using CSMA/CD Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection where it is running half duplex (one side can send at any given time)
- Full duplex disregards CSMA/CD because there is no collision. However, if one device is set to half-duplex and the other device is set to full-duplex, there will be an issue
ex. if 10Mbps is the speed of normal traffic, enabling full duplex in theory will increase to 20Mbps becaues you can receive and send 10Mbps both ways

Adding MAC Address to Routers
Router#configure Terminal
Router(config)#interface f0/0
Router(config-if)#mac-address 0023.3300.0001 (note* 0023.33 is Cisco's allocated MAC address)
Router(config-if)#no shutdown

BUM traffic = Broadcast Unknown-unicast, Multicast
- When a switch receives an unknown unicast packet to an unknown unicast address, it floods all interfaces except from which it was received

Unicast, Multicast, Broadcast
- Unicast does not flood all ports unless MAC address is unknown
- Multicast (if vlan is not configured) it will flood all ports
- Broadcast always flood all ports
