Address Classes IPv4

- Class A (unicast)
- Class B (unicast)
- Class C (unicast)
- Class D - multicast (one device talking to a group of device, rather than 1 to 1)
- Class E - reserved for future or experimental purposes
* classful addresses superseeded by CIDR (classless interdomain routing) in 1993
* allocated by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

Class A (start with binary 1 - 1XXXXXXX)

- first 8 bits = network
- Start with 1, end with 126  1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255
- 0 is reserved for default network, and 127 is reserved for loopback
- [00000000 network],[00000000,00000000,00000000 hosts]

Class B (start with binary 10 - 10XXXXXX)

- first 16 bits = network
- Start with 128, end with 192 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
- [00000000, 00000000 network],[00000000,00000000 hosts]

Class C (start with binary 110 -> 110XXXXX)

- first 24 bits = network
- Start with 192, end with 223 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
- [00000000, 00000000,00000000 network],[00000000 hosts]

Class D - multicast 

- 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255

Class E - reserved for future or experimental purposes

- 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255

Directed Broadcast Address

- Host sends data to all devices on a specific network
- It is when all host bits at set to 1s
  ex. network 172.31.0.0 => broadcast 172.31.255.255
- Routers can route directed broadcast, but it is disabled by default to prevent hacking utilities (ex. Smurf) performing DoS attacks

Local Broadcast Address

- communicate with all devices on local network
- address is all binary 1s 255.255.255.255
  ex. host requests an IP address from DHCP server Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- local broadcast address is ALWAYS dropped by router, however this can be bypassed with DHCP forwarding or DHCP relay
  ex. device B (vlan 10) connects through a router A to the DHCP server (vlan20) through a router. However, it broadcasts out DHCP request, but blocked by router A. When DHCP forwrading or relay is turned on, then router A blocks this broadcast request, but proxies a unicast DHCP request to the DHCP server on behalf of device B

Local loopback address

- 127.0.0.1 -> system send a message to itself (anything in range 127.X.X.X is loopback, anyone can be used to test this TCP/IP stack is correctly installed on a machine)
- Notice 127.0.0.1 is class A, therefore design flaw of IPv4 to use this class A address for this purpose, loses 16 million addresses
- IPv6 uses "::1"
  *Routers and Switches loopback address ("loopback interface") is different than Local loopback address

Private Addresses

- Request for Comments is a formal document (Internet Engineering Task Force IETF drafted by a community from multiple vendors), changes can be made only by another RFC - it can be superseeded
- Internet Standards
- RFC1918: private IP addresses are non routable addresses on the internet, blocked by ISP
    Blocked by IANA Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
    -> 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255
    -> 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255
    -> 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255
- RFC3927: IPv4 Link-Local Addresses, Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA) by Microsoft. Range 169.254.0.0 /16. Allows devices through a cable or local segment (switch) to communicate to each other when no DHCP server is available without configuration. Host would randomly generate the host specific part of the address

Subnet Mask

- Local vs Remote
  -> if the network portion of the device A is the same as device B, then A and B are on the same network - hence, local - otherwise the A is remote to B

Discontiguous Subnet Mask

- Subnet mask must start with Binary 1s and afterwards 0s have to be together ex 255.240.0.0 = 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000
- Discontiguous subnet mask is inconsistent, ex. 240.255.3.191 = 11110000.11111111.00000110.11000000
  *Discontiguous subnet mask is not supported by Cisco devices

CIDR (Classless InterDomain Routing - introduced in 1993)

- Replaced classful IP addressing
- Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)
  ex. CIDR notation = /24 instead of 255.255.255.0 or /11 = 255.224.0.0 (not on Octet)
