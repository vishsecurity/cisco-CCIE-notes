SDN Software Defined Networking - 3 visions
1) OpenSDN - Original vision at Stanford
- "The physical separation of network control plane from forwarding plane, and where a control plane controls several devices"
2) "SDN via Overlays" vision: "NSX from VMWare" 
- Virtual network overlays a Physical network (underlay Network)
3) Brite Box / White Box SDN: "Pica8, Cumulus Networks" 
- Run OS that can be installed on multiple devices 
(X) Don't buy Proprietary hardware, OS, features
(Y) Buy Switches that are not tied to a specific vendor (Facebook Switches: 6 pack wedge - open modular switch)
4) SDN via APIs Application Program Interfaces
- Using APIs instead of traditional CLIs
5) Open Stack
- Manage all of networking devices, servers, storage from a single management console
6) NFV Network Function Virtualization
(X) Don't run specific hardware on specific OS
(Y) Virtualize networking devices/functions/OS, rather than having a specific device performs that one function

OpenSDN vs OpenFlow
- Microsoft: OpenSDN is used to overcome traditional problems of networking
- NSA: OpenFlow is used to provide simplicity to the current network and provide more control
