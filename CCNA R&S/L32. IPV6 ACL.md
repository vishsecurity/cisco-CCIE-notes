IPv6 ACL Access Control List
- 1st line of defence... should also have IPS Intrusion Prevention System, Firewall, Protocol analyzers
- Permit or deny traffic in your network

**IPv6 CCNA focus
- Use IPv6 to filter IPv6 packets received & transmitted via Routers

IPv6 IPv4 ACL similarities
> ACL can match on 
- Source/Destination IP Address
- Individual host address
- Subnets in both inbound/outbound
- Protocols (TCP, UDP, Port #)
- ICMP message
*Both uses implicit deny/deny all statement at the end
*Cannot copy IPv4 ACLs to IPv6 ACLs

IPv6 IPv4 ACL differences
1)
- IPv6 ACL and IPv4 ACL are independent of each other (i.e. the same source can be allowed in IPv6A ACL, but denied on IPv4 ACL)
2)
- IPv6 ACL has "Implicit Permit", IPv4 ACL does not, only has "Implicit Deny"/"Deny any any" (which IPv6 also have)
3)
**IPv4 ACL uses NAME/NUMBER (recall Standard (filter Source ONLY) = 1-99, Extended (filter Source and Destination) = 100-199)
**IPv6 ACL only use NAMES (Standard and Extended are still used, but using WORDS instead)
4)
- IPv4 match on Precedence, ToS Type of Service, TTL, fragments
- IPv6 match on Flow label, DSCP, Extentions and option header values
5) 
- IPv4 ACL match on /22,/23,/24,/25
- IPv6 ACL match on a hex-digit boundary /48,/52,/56,/64

~ICMPv6
- Remember, ARP was used to determine MAC address of neighbor, ARP no longer used in IPv6 
**ARP (IPv4) == ICMPv6 (IPv6), you dont want to block ICMPv6 as it provides basic IPv6 functionality (Neighbor Discovery Protocol NDP & Path MTU Discovery)
