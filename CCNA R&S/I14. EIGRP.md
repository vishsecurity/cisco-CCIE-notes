EIGRP Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
**Best route based on: Bandwidth, Load, Delay, Reliability
- Used for exchanging routes between routers
- Cisco Proprietary (industry standard: OSPF)
- Classless (subnet mask included with route)
- Support discontiguous networks, auto-summarization is enabled by default
- Above Layer 3 (Network) port 88
- Uses RTP Reliable Transport Protocol because below TCP/UDP layer 4 (NOT Realtime Transport Protocol in VoIP)
- Advanced distance vector protocol
- Uses link-local multicast 224.0.0.10, unicast, not broadcast (IGRP uses broadcast)
- Features Hybrid: Takes best principals from (Link State Routing Protocol and Distance Vector Routing Protocol)
- Features 100% loop free classless routing - DUAL Diffusing Update Algorithm (OSPF uses SPF algorithm)
- Features Partial updates send to pre-existing neighbours and Full updates on new neighbours (RIP sends entire routing table every 30seconds, OSPF database synchronization every 30 minutes)
- Features load balancing across equal and unequal cost paths (10packets in 10mbs link and 2packets in 2mbs link) - can use lower speed links
- Features Rapid Convergence - backup routes (Feasible Successors) are pre-calculated
> Back-up routes is immediately installed in routing table when best route (Successor) is lost
> In RIP, when the best route is lost, back-up routes are calculated then, whereas EIGRP, routes are pre-calculated

EIGRP Packet Types
> Hello: Estbalish neighbor relationships on multicast 224.0.0.10 using MD5 authentication
> - Hold timer: Determine if neighbor has failed
> Update: Send routing updates
> Query: Ask neighbors about routing information
> Reply: Respond to Query
> ACK: Acknowledge a reliable packet

EIGRP Autonomous System #
- Must be the same AS to form neighbor relationships and exchange routes
- Metric weights must match (K values)

EIGRP K values
**K valuve used to determine best path and route to destination
- Values from 0 - 255
K1 = Bandwidth modifier
K2 = Load modifier
K3 = Delay modifier
K4 = Reliability modifier
K5 = Additional Reliability modifier

EIGRP Metrics
**Metrics weights must match
K Values are not metrics themselves, 0-255
- 6 K values in total, but the below 4 are used in vector computing
K1 = Bandwidth (default = 1)
> slowest bandwidth between source and destination
> K2 = Load (0) [by default, not used]
> K3 = Delay (1)
> 10s of ms, cumulative interface delay from your router to destination network
> K4 = Reliability (0) [by default, not used]
> ~K5 = Additional Reliability modifier (0)
- Last 2: MTU Maximum Transmission Unit, Hop count
**Load and Reliability, if not used is in EIGRP because it was originally used by IGRP and was kept during migration
***Composite Metric Formula = Final Value of all K values
***Metric = 256 * (bandwidth + delay)
Metric = 256 * (bandwidth of slowest link + sum of delays) since all other values are 0 or not used	

MTU
- Maximum amount of data that you can insert in a single packet over a physical medium
- MTU is exchanged in EIGRP packets
- Used as a tie breaker between 2 equal paths, those with the lowest MTU is not used, only for INBOUND updates

Hop count
- Maximum 255 or 224
- Used to limit EIGRP AS to 255 or 224 hops

EIGRP TLDR
1) EIGRP routers send "hello" by default on multicast 224.0.0.10
2) EIGRP routers listens for "hello" on interfaces with EIGRP enabled
3) Once received "hello", those neighbours are added to EIGRP neighbor tables
4) EIGRP table is populated from its learned EIGRP neighbours along with its interface
5) EIGRP Topology table contains not only the best routes, but all the routes learned (successor routes, fessible routes, distances)
6) EIGRP will use composite metric to determine the best routes, and put those best routes in the EIGRP routing table (successor routes)

EIGRP Dual Algorithm
- Selects lowest-cost, loop-free  paths to each destination
- AD Advertise Distance: cost between next-hop router and destination (cost for EIGRP neighbour to reach destination
- FD Feasible Distance: cost from local router = AD + cost between local router and the next hop router
R1 <-> R2 <-> R3
**The FD for R1 -> R3 is R1 = Distance of R2->R3 + Distance of R1->R2

EIGRP Dual Algorithm..
***No need to recalculate, Feasible successor is ready for when Successor goes down
- Successor = main route
- Feasible successor = backup route (chosen based on the alternative route's AD must be lower than FD)
ex. R4: FD = 25
R2: FD = 35 (AD = 15)
R5: FD = 50 (AD = 30)
> Since R2's AD is 15, it can become the Feasible successor. R5 however cannot be chosen as Feasible successor because AD > FD.
> **Once R4 goes down, R2 will immediately become the Successor route
> ex. Becomes...
> R2: FD = 35 (AD = 15)
> R5: FD = 50 (AD = 30), since 30 < 35, then R5 becomes the new Feasible successor
> **If 2 path's AD are the same, there will be no Feasible successor (require neighbours to determine successors) and may be hidden from the command "R1#show ip eigrp topology", therefore we need to use "R1#show ip eigrp topology all-links"

**Recall K-number and AS MUST MATCH

EIGRP Load Balancing
- Supports both Equal and Unequal load balancing
- Default "maximum metric variance = 1": Equal cost load balancing (1) and 4 routes with minimum metric
- Support up to 16 routes using 'maximum-path' command

EIGRP Unequal Load Balancing
- Variance must be changed to utilize Unequal Load Balancing, default is set to 1
- Variance is the multiplier by taking the path with the smallest cost and multiplies it by Variance
*2 Conditions must be met:
1) FD > AD
2) FD * Variance > current path cost

EIGRP auto summarization
- EIGRP is a classless protocol, but by default, auto summarization is turned on - it is best to turn this off immediately
ex. R1 (10.1.1.0 /24 f0/0) <-> R2 (10.0.0.0/8 f0/0 & f0/1) <-> R3 (10.1.2.0/24 f0/1), R2 will send packets to both R1 and R3 if auto summarization is not turned off. R1 will ping R3 and following will happen:
> ping 10.1.1.1
> result: .!.!.
> R1 -> R2 -> R3
> R1 -> R2 -> R1
> R1 -> R2 -> R3
> R1 -> R2 -> R1
> R1 -> R2 -> R3
> ***This happens because although 10.1.1.0 is advertised as /24, its 10.X.X.X roots is /8
- After auto-summary is turned off, then the route looks as follows...
> R2 (10.1.1.0/24 f0/0 & 10.1.2.0/24 f0/1)
- Note: Also after no auto-summary, Null0 routes and summarized routes are removed

==Turn off EIGRP Auto-summary==
R1#conf t
R1(config)#router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)#no auto-summary

EIGRP MD5 authentication
- Support ONLY MD5 Hashing
- Hashes an arbitary length into 128bit value
- Every EIGRP update (send & receive) includes the hash for authentication
- Each participating neighbor must have the same key ID & key string
- EIGRP interface can interact with RIP interface, but must specify which keychain the interface will use

==Setup key ID & key string==
R1#conf t
R1(config)#key chain nameOfKeyGroup (name of key group)
R1(config-keychain)#key numericValue (key ID)
R1(config-keychain-key)#key-string stringValue (key string)
==Setup key group with EIGRP==
> R1 s1/0 <-> s1/0 R2 
> R1(config-keychain-key)#int s1/0
> R1(config-if)#ip authentication mode eigrp 100 md5
> R1(config-if)#ip authentication key-chain eigrp 100 nameOfKeyGroup
> R2#conf t
> R2(config)#key chain nameOfKeyGroupDoesNotNeedToMatchHere (name of key group)
> R2(config-keychain)#key numericValue (key ID)
> R2(config-keychain-key)#key-string stringValue (key string)
> R2(config-keychain-key)#int s1/0
> R2(config-if)#ip authentication mode eigrp 100 md5
> R2(config-if)#ip authentication key-chain eigrp 100 nameOfKeyGroupDoesNotNeedToMatchHere
> ==Show key chain==
> R1#show key chain

For EIGRP to work:
- EIGRP Neighbor must be on common subnet
- Neighbor K values must be equal 
- Neighbor AS must be equal
- Note: Access List can block EIGRP
