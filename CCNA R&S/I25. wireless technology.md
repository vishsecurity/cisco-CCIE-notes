WAN Technologies:
- Frame Relay
- ATM
- DSL
- PPP
- HDLC

WAN PPP Point-to-Point Protocols (aka Serial Link)
- Provides dedicated connection between 2 sites
- Leased Line (Monthly Fee)
- These days, replaced by VPN using DSL used instead of PPP
- Connection between 2 points, rather than multiple points

WAN HDLC High-Level Data Link Control

WIC WAN Interface Card
- Uses T1 CSU Channel Service Unit / DSU Data Service Unit (X.21 / V.35 cable)

VPN Virtual Private Networks
- Replaced Leased Line

Leased Lines 
- Synchronous Serial Communication - one party provides the clocking for the communication
> 2 devices will synchronized their clocks before data transfer takes place to ensure data does not get corrupted
- CSU DSU (aka CSU) provides the clocking and is the master for communication
- Router acts as a Slave, receives clocking from CSU

DCE and DTE:
- DCE Data Communication Equipment (ISP) -> CSU DSU (ISP's box) -> DTE Data Terminal Equipment (receives clocking from CSU DSU - onsite router)

~Devices:
WIC 1T - 1 serial cable/connection
WIC 2T - 2 serial cable/connection
WIC 4T - 4 serial cable/connection

Advantage of Leased Line:
- Easy configuration
- High QoS
- Bandwidth of connection is dedicated only to you and you alone
- Permanent

Disadvantage of Leased Line 
- Expensive
- Charged whether you use it or not
- Limited to the speed of the link

Leased Line (aka T or E carrer system)

Nyquist Theorem 
- Converts Analog Voice to Digital 64KBPS stream (Time Division Multiplexing)

US Speeds
DSO Digital Signal level 0 = 64kbps
T1 = 24 x DS0 = 1.544Mbps
T2 = 4 * T1
T3 = 28 * T1
T4 = 168 * T1

Euro Speeds
E1 = 30 x DS0 = 2Mbps 
E2 = 4 * E1
E3 = 17 * E1
E4 = 70 * E1

WAN Technologies
1) PSTN Public Switch Telephone Network
- Layer 2 protocols (HDLC High-Level Data Link Control, PPP)
- PPP has advange because it has authentication
- Circuit switched, dedicated path is setup for the duration of the call
- Analog Asynchronous: Insert START/STOP bits in the same channel as the data. START bit prior to each byte of data. Uses STOP bit after each byte of data - lowers cost of equipment
- NOT DIGITAL
- Does NOT use clock to differentiate between bytes of data is to use START/STOP bits 
ADVANTAGE: Simple, Availability, Cost
DISADVANTAGE: Slow (33-56kbps), upgrade ISDN (64-128kbps)
2) Leased Line
- Serial / Point-to-Point link between 2 sites with dedicated bandwidth
- Leased from Service Provider
- Connects to a CSU DSU Channel service unit/ digital service unit 
- Synchronized clocks for Data Transfer, before transfer they must align their clock
- DCE Data Communication Equipment uses Internal Clocking (Server Provider provides this)
- DTE Data Terminal Equipment uses External Clock (Customer side of WAN connection) -> dependent on DCE (Modem/DCE/CSU/DSU)
- X.21 / V.35 cable
ADVANTAGES: Simple, High QoS, Permanent Connection
DISADVANTAGE: Cost, charged for circuit - if you don't use it, you are still charged, no ability to go above speed set (burst)
3) Packet Switched
- Serial / Point-to-Point link between 2 sites with shared bandwidth
ADVANTAGE: Cost, potential to use above speed limit if other user is not using (burst)
DISADVANTAGE: Share

DTE DCE 
- If connecting 2 routers both females, 1 of the routers must be the DCE. Cable will determine which side is the DCE and which side is DTE
- 21, 35, 232, 449
- DCE = Female
- DTE = Male

==Setup Serial Interface clock rate - DCE==
**Default speed is T1
**Bandwidth is especially important to OSPF and EIGRP because those protocols use bandwidth in their calculations to determine best route

Types of HDLC
[Flag][Address][Control][Data][FCS][Flag]
1) HDLC High-Level Data Link Control [Industry Standard]
- Missing Proprietary field, cannot run IPx and IPv4 OR IPv4 and IPv6 at same time
2) Cisco HDLC High-Level Data Link Control [Cisco ONLY]
- Includes [PROPRIETARY]
- Can run both IPv4 and IPv6 at same time
3) PPP [Industry Standard]
- Includes [PROTOCOL]
- Can run both IPv4 and IPv6 at same time
- Layer 2
- Multilink PPP - makes several links as a single link
- Support multiple higher layer protocols, authentication (PAP, CHAP)
- PAP - clear Text
- CHAP - MD5 Hash, uses Router's name for authentication

Frame Relay 
- Replaced by MPLS Multiple Protocol Label Switching
- Replaced X.25 (error checking at Layer 2) 
- Frame Relay does not error check, relys on TCP
- Shared Packet Switched environment where companies share the bandwidth
- Sites are setup as SVC Switch Virtual Circuits (acts like a phone call - only brought up when required) or PVC Permanent Virtual Circuits (permanent connection from 1 site to another site)
- Speeds up to 4Mbps
- Switches are programmed to deal with DLCI Data Link Control Identifier. Once it receives a specific DLCI, the switch has been programmed to switch frames of XXX to YYY.
***Think. Traffic are directed with DLCI
- Routers learn each other's IP addresses using "Inverse ARP" - "I tell you my IP address without me requesting for it"
ADVANTAGES: Cost, Bursting

ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode
- Developed to carry voice, video and data across a single infrastructure
- Higher speed than Frame Relay up to 155Mbps
- ATM is good for voice because data is broken up - broken up data 53bytes is good reduces delay and jitter when voice has to be transmitted after data packets
- Physical Media uses SONET/SDH, Optical Fibre
- VPI/VCI Virtual Path/Channel Identifier is similar to DLCI 

ADSl Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line
- Home setup - phone and data used together
- Voice and data is split by frequency through the use of a splitter
ADVANTAGE: Single analog cable into home (= less cost)	

DSL 
ADVANTAGE: Speed, simultaneous voice/data transmission, always on, backward compatible to analog phone
DISADVANTAGE: limited availability, local phone company requirement, security risk (permanently on)
1) ADSL Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
- up/down speed is unequal
- analog phone and internet at the same time
2) SDSL Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line
- up/down speed is EQUAL
- no analog telephone calls (VoIP is useful here)

**Point-to-point/back-to-back link, DTE interfaces must have bandwidth, DCE interfaces must have both bandwidth and clock rate
**MAC addresses are used on Ethernet Segment, but not used on HDLC (HDLC will reference which higher level protocol will be used - IPv4, IPv6)

Protocols:
Unicast = (0x0f)
CDP = (0x2000)
IPv4 = (0x0800)
IPv6 = (0x86dd)

PPP Advantages
- Multiple Vendors 
- Multiple Protocols simultaneously (IPv4, IPv6)
- Authentication and multilink (present multiple interfaces (physical interfaces) as a single link to higher protocols (IPv4 would think it is a single link))

PPP Authentication
- Layer 2 similar to HDLC
1) PAP Password Authentication Protocol (clear text)
2) CHAP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MD5 Hash)

PPP Protocols
1) LCP Link Control Protocol
- Manages features (authentications, multilink)
2) NCP Network Control Protocol
> Allow multiple higher layer protocols to traverse single link by using NCP
> NCP for IPv4 = IPCP
> NCP for CDP = CDPCP
> NCP for IPv6 = IPv6CP
- Therefore, to use both IPv4 and IPv6, PPP would need to use both IPCP and IPv6CP
**Again PPP is Layer 2 Protocol, therefore in order to support Layer 3 IPv4 and IPv6, must use a single leased line with the help of IPCP and IPv6CP

PPP 3 phases of link establishment
1) Link establishment phase
- PPP devices send LCP packets to configure and test the Data Link (negotiate which authentication method (PAP, CHAP), multilink?)
2) Authentication Phase (OPTIONAL)
- Device to choose PAP? CHAP? both?
3) Network Layer Protocol Phase
- Devices choose to use IPv4? IPv6? both?

PPP PAP
- Requires ONLY password
- Cleartext Password
- Remote peer is in control of authentication attempt (no protection from repeated attempts)
- router's running config (local database) stores the usernames/passwords

PPP CHAP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
**CCNA level, make sure hostnames are configured correctly
- Requires username and password
- MD5 Hash (hash data to 128bit value) - aka Trap door (you cant take hash value and come up with original value)

PPP CHAP Process
> R1 wants to authenticate with R2 (challenger)
1) R2 sends CHAP challenge Packet to R1
[CHAP challenge packet type identifier][identifier id][random #][nameOfSender]
*R2 might be challenging multiple remote devices, therefore needs [identifier id] to keep track
*[random #] stops playback attacks
**2) R1 receives the challenge, enters passsword
3) R1 will then hash the 3 fields together MD5# = [password + identifier id + random #]
4) R1 sends the 3 fields back to R2, inserting MD5# where random# was
5) R2 will compare the Z to its hash

==TLDR==
R1 <- R2
**[id] is kept
--1) [01][id][random][R2]--
R1 -> R2
--2) [02][id][MD5#][R1]--

PPP Two authentication method (using both PAP and CHAP)
- Only one of the authentication methods will ever be used but you can have the other on standby
i.e. R1 (PAP, then CHAP) - R2 (CHAP), then CHAP will be used
i.e. R1 (CHAP, then PAP) - R2 (CHAP), then CHAP will be used
i.e. R1 (CHAP, then PAP) - R2 (PAP), then PAP will be used
i.e. R1 (PAP, then CHAP) - R2 (PAP, then CHAP), then PAP will be used, CHAP will not be used

***CHAP, routers use their hostname for authentication
***CHAP, passwords must be the same for both sides
*If username/password is changed after successful login, no error

==PPP PAP username/password==
R1 s2/0 <-> s2/0 R2
> Create R1 local user
> R1(config)#username User2 password cisco

Multilink PPP
- Makes 2 or more serial links appear as a single physical link
- If one of the links go down, multilink will still be up. If all links go down, then multilink goes down
- Accomplished via "Virtual Multilink Interface" by fragmenting packets across both links
ex. PC1 -> R1 s0/0 & s0/1 R2 -> PC2, R1 will fragment a packet onto the 2 links, then R2 will join them back again to continue transmission to PC2 - PC2 would not know fragment took place
- Multilink used to be used on single physical links, because it provides fragmentation
- Wireshark will show errors about fragments (if 2 or more links), but it will fail checksum. However, when all links are disabled down to 1 link, then there will be no error, because on a single link, no fragmentation will take place
- Fragmentation/Reassemble is based on "Sequence number" in the Multilink Protocol
