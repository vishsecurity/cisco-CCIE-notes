Transport Layer TCP/IP
- IP Internet Protcol is connectionless - every packet is treated individual and separately by routers
- IP does not gurantee delivery of packets, in correct order, or free from errors (higher layers are responsible for this)

TCP/UDP
- TCP Transmission Control Protocol - 3-way handshake, connection oriented, reliable, delivery acknowledgement (sequence number), sequenced, HTTP/E-mail/FTP
- UDP User Datagram Protocol - connectionless, best effort/unreliability, no gurantee of delivery, no sequencing, limited error delivery (if no port # available, message can be send to sender?), VOIP/Video-Streaming
- Allows for Session Multiplexing - single host with single IP address can communicate with mutliple device/session
- Connection must first be established between sender and receiver before data transmission in SEGMENTS
- MTU Maximum Transmission Unit depends on physical medium (ex. MTU of FastEthernet is 1500bytes, MTU  of TCP support 65495 bytes)
- MSS Maximum Segment Size is the maximum segment size that TCP is willing to send in a single segment, should be set small enough to avoid IP fragmentation which leads to excessive retransmission if there is packet loss
- TCP supports MSS and Path MTU Discovery (sender and receiver automatically determine maximum transmission - avoid fragmentation)
- Path MTU Discovery is mandatory in IPv6
- UDP does not support Path MTU Discovery - relies on higher layer protocols
- TCP has Flow Control (sliding window) to avoid data being sent too quickly - data sent too quickly will be dropped and require retransmission (causes delay), UDP has no Flow Control
- TCP has session, and once transmission is complete, session is terminated. UDP has no sessions
- TCP every segment is transmitted is acknowledged
- UDP Header 16bit UDP length: minimum 8 bytes, maximum 65,535 bytes (everything is 16)

TCP Summary
- Connection Oriented
- Full duplex operation
- Error checking (checksum in datagram to confirm this)
- Segments are sequenced
- Acknowledgement of receipt
- Retransmission of data is possible



3-way TCP Handshake

1) [Host A->Host B] Send SYN (flag), set CTL = SYN, chooses random initial sequence number (ex. 100) so it knows the next sequence number to expect from Host B, chooses port #
2) [Host A<-Host B] Received SYN (flag), Send SYN, Send ACK (from ex. ACK = 101, next in sequence to 100), set CTL = SYN, ACK, chooses another random initial sequence number so it knows the next sequence number to expect from Host A
3) [Host A->Host B] SYN flag = unset, set CTL = ACK, set ACK = 301, set SEQ = 101
*SYN flag is unset confirms the 3-way TCP Handshake is completed successfully

3-way TCP Handshake Simplified
1) Host A -> Send SYN, SEQ = 100 -> Host B
2) Host A <- Send SYN, ACK = 101, Send SEQ = 300 <- Host B
3) Host A -> Send ACK = 301, SEQ = 101 -> Host B

3-way TCP Handshake SYN/ACK Simplified
1) Host A -> Send Sequence = 5 (Host A expects Acknowledgement of 6) -> Host B
2) Host A <- Send Ack = 6, Send Sequence = 10 (Host B expects Acknowledgment of 11) <- Host B
3) Host A -> Send Ack = 11, Send Sequence 6 -> Host B

TCP Window Size / Fixed Windows
- Maximum number of data segments the sender is allow to send
Note* Above is a Window Size of "1"
- If we increase to Window Size of "3", then Host A can send 3 SYN, but only need to receive 1 ACK. Therefore, increasing throughput

TCP Flow Control
- Prevents issue of sender overflowing the buffers of a receiver if one machine is more powerful than the other, they can negotiate the rate of transmission
- Tells sending Host to slow down or to stop sending data until the host has its Receive Buffer Ready

TCP Sliding Widnows
- Rather than using Fixed Window Size, TCP uses sliding windows (window size, initial is small, then increase it exponentially with time) - notice how initial slow download, but then gets fast
- When packet is dropped, Window Size may be reduced
- Determining Window Size is either 1) Granted by receiver 2) Congestion Window (CWND) - initially set to very low value, then increases at exponential rate using "congestion avoidance"
