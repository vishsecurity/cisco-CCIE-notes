MPLS (1) Multiprotocol (2) Label (3) Switching
**Troubleshooting not on CCNA***

- (1) Multiprotocol means support IPv4, IPv6, Layer 2
- (3) Switching from one interface/protocol to another on a router using Labels (2)
- 2 mains uses: Layer 3 VPNs and Layer 2 VPNs
- In Layer 3 used to seperate customer traffic by IP, similar to VLAN seperates traffic in Layer 2

MPLS Layer3 VPN ex.

> EdgeDevice1 <-> R1 <-> R2 <-> R3 <-> R4 <-> EdgeDevice2

- Traditionally, all ED1, ED2, R1-4 would need to know how to send/receive traffic if we were to send from ED1 to ED2. With MPLS, R2-3 does not need to know how to route ED1 to ED2, instead R1 would put a "Label" on the traffic with information to send to R4, R4 will know how to send it to ED2

MPLS Terminology

- LSR Label Switch Router
  
  > EdgeDevice1 -> R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> EdgeDevice2
  > R2, R3 = Provider Routers
  > R1, R4 = Provider Edge Routers (Connected to Provider and to Customers)
  > R1, R4 = Intermediate LSR
  > ED1, ED2 = Customer Edge Routers (VRF Virtual, Routing, and Forwarding - indicates Customer Virtual Network)
  > R1 = Ingress LSR a.k.a Edge LSR (Inserts a "Label" between Layer 2 Header and Layer 3 Header)
  > R4 = Egress LSR

MPLS LSP Label Switch Path

> EdgeDevice1 -> R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> EdgeDevice2

1) ED1 sends packet to R1
2) R1 inserts a "Label" (i.e. 20) between Layer 2 header and Layer 3 header (aka Layer 2.5 Header) into the Egress Network (Outer Label)
3) R1 sends to R2
4) R2 swaps the Label to 21 (not sequential), then forwards it to R3
5) R3 swaps the Label to 22 (not sequential), then forwards it to R4
6) R4 strips the "Label" (Inner Label), then forwards to ED2 without a label in the Customer Network
   **R1 -> R4, sends a label known as "Next Hop Label"

MPLS Traffic Engineering 

- OSPF does not load balance
- EIGRP does some unequal cost load balancing
  *MPLS provides a lot of flexibility in load share traffic across multiple paths based on link utilization - reroute traffic based on 1) Load 2) Traffic Type
  i.e. VoIP will take path 1, FTP will take path 2

MPLS Labels

- 32bit header inserted between Layer 2 and 3 Header
  [20bit Label][3bit Experimental Field (QoS)][1bit Bottom-of-Stack indicator (Outer/Inner Label)][3bit Time-to-live (Stop Loops)]
