Classful networks A,B,C 

- Not scalable
- RIPv1, IGRP

CIDR Classless Interdomain Routing

- Scalable
- Based on VLSM Variable Length Subnet Mask 
- **RIPv2, **EIGRP, OSPF
  **Acts as Classful by default, you need to use "no auto-summary" command

Summarization

- Instead of sending all of the advertisements of IPs on a network to another network, we can send a single advertisement
- Hides topology, if a single router goes down inside a network, the other network won't know about it

ex. 10.1.10/24 - 10.1.200.0/24 can be summarized into network 10.1.0.0 /16. Full connectively can remain estbalished with 10.1.0.0 /16
----

ex. 172.16.32.0/24 - 172.16.63.0/24 can be viewed as follows...
172.16.32.0 172.16. 0010 0000 . 0
172.16.63.0 172.16. 0011 1111 . 0 
So... we have 0010, or 32. Therefore, the summary address will be 172.16.32.0 /19

----

ex. 172.16.64.0/24 - 172.16.127.0/24... NOTICE....
** It's always just the first bit, therefore 172.16.64.0  /18

Classful Routing - assumes everyone is using the same network mask, summary routes are automatic
Classless Routing - includes networkmask, summary routes can be manually configured

Auto Summarization occurs when:

- Cross classful boundaries class A/B/C
- Cross major network boundaries 10.0.0.0 to 11/12.0.0.0

How will a router choose its route?

1) Choose longest match -> Most specific. /27 is more specific than /16
2) If IP address and mask is all the same, then it will be decided by lowest administrative distance (EIGRP > OSPF > RIPv2)
