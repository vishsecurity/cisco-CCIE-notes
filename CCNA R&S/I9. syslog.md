Syslog Protocol
Numerical         Severity
             Code
              0       Emergency: system is unusable (ex. System shutting down)
              1       Alert: action must be taken immediately (ex. temperature reached)
              2       Critical: critical conditions (ex. memory allocation error)
              3       Error: error conditions (ex. Interface up/down messages)
              4       Warning: warning conditions (ex. Configuration file written by SNMP request)
              5       Notice: normal but significant condition (ex. Line protocol down)
              6       Informational: informational messages (ex. Access List violation)
              7       Debug: debug-level messages
ex. *Mar 1 00:06:38.895: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console
> 5 is the Syslog Code

==See Logging==
R1#show logging
==Change Console/Monitor Logging level==
> If you change logging level to 5, then only 0-5 is enabled, similar 4, then only 0-4
> Change console to 5 and monitor to 3 (error)
> R1#conf t
> R1(config)#logging console 5 or notice
> R1(config)#logging monitor error or 3
> ==Disable commands being retyped in Console==
> R1(config)#line console 0
> R1(config-line)#no logging synchronous
> ==Enable OSPF on Adjacency events==
> R1#debug ip ospf adj
> ==Setup passwords/Telnet to 192.168.1.223==
> R2#conf t
> R2(config)#line vty 0 4
> R2(config-line)#login
> R2(config-line)#password cisco
> R2(config-line)#exit
> R2(config)#enable password cisco
> **By default, terminal monitor function is turned on by default on Console. However, for monitor (cmd/VTY - via Telnet), we must use the following command: "R1#terminal monitor"
> ==Disable console logging==
> R1#conf t
> R1(config)#no logging console
> ==Enable Buffered Logging Level & Size==
> R1#conf t
> R1(config)#logging buffered 7 
> R1(config)#logging buffered 64000 [size]
> ==View the buffered log/search==
> After buffer is turned on (off by default), you can view the log
> R1#show log
> R1#show log | include BDR
> **Notice: logs can become quite extensive, therefore it will be better to have a Syslog server
> ==Log content (Must have GNS3 and Kiwilog enabled)==
> Kiwilog server is 192.168.1.108 and trap debugging (7)
> R1#conf t
> R1(config)#logging 192.168.1.108
> R1(config)#logging trap 7
> ==Add Syslog sequence number==
> R1#conf t
> R1(config)#service sequence-numbers
> Other functions...
> R1(config)#service timestamps log datetime msec (millisecs) year
> R1(config)#service timestamps log uptime
