SPAN Switch Port Analyzer
- Mirror / Monitor a port or VLAN by either sending that port's traffic to another port, or sending VLAN1's traffic to another port - make copies of Ethernet Frames

Remote SPAN 
- Copy Ethernet Frames from a local switch to a remote switch

```
==Setup SPAN (monitor)==

> Capture data that goes through Switch1 vlan 1, then send it to port f1/0/5
> S1#conf t
> S1(config)#monitor session [randomNumberIsSwitchDependent**]
> S1(config)#monitor session 1 source vlan 1 both [both = sent and receive]
> S1(config)#monitor session 1 destination interface fastEthernet 1/0/5
> Setup session 2 in a similar way, and change destination to session 2
> S1(config)#monitor session 2 source interface f1/0/3
> S1(config)#no monitor session 1 destination interface fastEthernet 1/0/5
> S1(config)#monitor session 2 destination interface fastEthernet 1/0/5
> 
> **Remember, a SPAN Destination port can only be used on a SINGLE SESSION
> ==Confirm==
> S1#do sh run | i monitor
> S1#show monitor
> ==Setup SPAN on 2 interfaces==
> Capture RECEIVE ONLY On both f1/0/3 and f1/0/1 
> S1#conf t
> S1(config)#monitor session 1 source interface fastEthernet 1/0/3, fastEthernet 1/0/1 rx
> ==Disable SPAN (monitor)==
> S1(config)#no monitor session 1
```



==Allow SPAN traffic==
**By default, SPAN ports' MAC Address is removed, therefore traffic is not accepted
S1(config)#monitor session 1 destination interface fastEthernet 1/0/5 ingress untagged vlan 1

SPAN overview:
- 1 SPAN destination port = 1 SPAN session at a time
- SPAN destination port =/= SPAN source port
- Multiple SPAN source ports are allowed
- 1 SPAN session cannot mix both interfaces and VLAN sources
- SPAN destination port is no longer treated as an ethernet port - MAC Address not learned by switch
