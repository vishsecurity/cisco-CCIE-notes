Router (local destination)
- Level 3 devices
- Routing decision based on IP addresses of the network address, rather than the individual device IP Address
?How it works?
1) Host A's ip address sending to Host B's ip address
2) Host A needs to know Host B's MAC address, using ARP Address Resolution Protocl
3) Host A checks its own ARP for whether it has stored Host B's MAC address - if it does not have Host B's MAC address, it will broadcast out who has Host B's ip address (ARP Request)
--ARP Request---
(Source MAC: XX)(Destination MAC: FFFFFFFF)(Source IP: ABC)(Destination IP: DEF)
4) Assume there are host b, c, d on the network. Host B will see that the ARP request and match the request ip address with its own ip, it will then send an (ARP Reply) and add Host A's MAC address to its ARP Cache. Host C and D will drop the frame because it does not match its own IP address
5) Host A will receive the frame and then it will update its own ARP Cache
**Note. If the device is on a remote network, then it will send the request to its gateway
