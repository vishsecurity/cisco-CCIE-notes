OSI Model (Open System Interconnect Model) - created by International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
Please do not throw sausage pizza away

- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport (TCP/UDP)
- Network (IP Address, Router, Layer 3 switch)
- Datalink (Mac Address, Bridge, Switches)
- Physical (RJ45, Hubs, Physical Interfaces)
  *Each layer is independent of each other

Layer 7 Application Layer

- FTP, Telnet, HTTP
- Use protocols to communicate with lower layers
- Provides network services to application, user authentication
- Not talking about individual application
- Talking about application protocol, not the application itself

Layer 6 Presentation Layer

- Ensures that data sent by one application is "readable" by another application (MP3 can be listened to online with Windows and iOS because data is presented in a format that both side understands)
- Formats data to be presented to application layer
- Negotiates data transfer syntax for application layer
- Provides encryption
- This data must be changed to "Machine independent format"
  ~ Imagine opening a JPG in Notepad

Layer 5 Session Layer

- Establish, maintain and terminate of sessions between applications
- Two application processes on different machines can establish session
  ex. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)
  ex. PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)

Layer 4 Transport Layer

- Message segmentation: segment the message in the upper layers into smaller units, then passes it down to Network layer for sending
- Handles transportation issues between hosts
- Ensures data transport reliability
- Flow control, makes sure it is not transferring more data than it can process
- Sessoin Multiplexing, multiple messages streams or sessions onto one logical link 
1) TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
   - reliability, maintains, and terminates virtual circuits
   - TCP 3-way handshake
   - If paket is missing, it will be retransmitted
2) UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - 
   - Does not provide reliability
   - If packets dropped, they are lost, does not retransmit lost packet

Layer 3 Network layer

- This layer is all about Data Delivery, how it routes data from one device to another 
- Concern with path determination
- 3 routing protocols in Layer 3 switches (router capable)
1) OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
2) BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
3) IS-IS (Intermediate Systems to Intermediate Systems)
   *No reliability at this level. Must depend on TCP. If UDP is used, application layer need to provide reliability. Ex. TFTP uses UDP at Layer 4, and IP at Layer 3 = no reliability. Therefore, TFTP must provide reliability

Layer 2 Data Link

- Concerns with how data is formatted for transmission 
  ex. Ethernet -> use MAC address XXXYYY = 48bits (made from OUI Organization Unique Identifier XXX + Unique Portion YYY)
- MAC Address is flat address structure VS IP Address is logically assigned. Therefore, Data Link does 
- Provides error detection
- Data link formats according to the type of Media (Ethernet, WAN link) into the appropriate Physical Link 

Layer 1 Physical

- Physical Device and Physical Cabling
- Specs of these media types

TCP/IP model

- Application Layer
- Transport Layer
- Internet Layer
- Network Access Layer

Host Communication:

- Layer 7 only talks to Layer 7 through encapsulation and decapsulation, similarly 1 -> 1 
- Encapsulation puts "header" onto the user data from L7 to L2, then FCS Frame Check Sequence occurs at the end to ensure there is no corruption 
  [User Data]
  [L7 Hdr][User Data]
  [L6 Hdr][L7 Hdr][User Data]
  [L5 Hdr][L6 Hdr][L7 Hdr][User Data]
  [L4 Hdr][L5 Hdr][L6 Hdr][L7 Hdr][User Data]
  [L3 Hdr][L4 Hdr][L5 Hdr][L6 Hdr][L7 Hdr][User Data]
  [L2 Hdr][L3 Hdr][L4 Hdr][L5 Hdr][L6 Hdr][L7 Hdr][User Data] FCS
  [Bits]
  ---through Physical Media as bits (0,1) ---

Transport layer transmits "Segments"
Network layer transmits "Packets"
Data Link layer transmits "Frames"
Physical layer transmits "Bits"

Protocol Data Unit (PDU) = segments, packets, frames, bits

Application Layer

- File Transfer: FTP File Transfer Protocol, TFTP Trivial File Transfer Protocol, NFS Network File System
- E-mail: POP3 Post Office Protocol 3 (receive e-mail), SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (send e-mail), IMAP Internet Message Access Protocol (receive e-mail)
- Remote Login: Telnet (sends traffic in clear text/insecure), SSH (secure shell/secure) 
- Network Management: SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol
- Name Management: DNS Domain Name System (translate domain names into ip addresses)

Recap 7 layers
**Physical (1) -> Data Link (2) -> Network (3) -> Transport (4) -> Application (7)
**(RJ45 -> MAC Address -> IP Address -> TCP/UDP -> Port Number)

Socket

- Combination of: IP address of host, port number, TCP/UDP (transport protocol used)

Port Numbers:

- 7 ping echo 
- 20 FTP Data
- 21 FTP 
- 22 SSH 
- 23 Telne
- 53 DNS TCP/UDP (UDP used to serve request, TCP is used when response data is over 512bytes)
- 69 TFTP 
- 80 HTTP 
- 115 SFTP 
- 161 SNMP
- 443 HTTPS 
  *Well known port numbers: 0 - 1023
  *Registered port numbers: 1024 - 49151
  *Dynamic/Private port numbers: 49152 - 65535
  *Ephemeral port numbers (short lived port used for client side of connection - temporary, only last for session) - varies based on vendor

ex. Get Host 1 (10.1.1.1) -> Switch -> Router (f0/0 10.1.1.254, f0/1 10.1.2.254)) -> Switch -> Remote Host 2 (10.1.2.1), host 1 to host 2 to talk to each other [[WHEN NO GATEWAY IS SET... we are setting a "gateway of last resort"]]
Host1> enable
Host1# conf t
Host1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.1.254 [this means, when Host1 does not know where to forward traffic without a gateway, it will go to 10.1.1.254)
...similarly... if host 2 wants to contact host 1 and does not know where to forward the traffic for any network that is not connected to them...
Host2> enable
Host2# conf t
Host2(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.2.254
**To confirm this: Host1> show ip route or Host2> show ip route

MAC vs IP Address through a router

- MAC address changes when going through a Layer 3 Router/switch - going from one Vlan or another / or 1 interface to another interface, MAC address is rewritten by the router
- IP address however remains the same, except when a NAT Network Address Translation is used

ex. Router1 -> Router2 -> Router 3
Goal: Router1 ping Router3

1) Router1 -> Router2 (ping request)
   Source MAC: Router1
   Destination MAC: Router2
   Source IP: Router1
   Destination IP: Router3
2) Router2 -> Router3 (ping request)
   Source MAC: Router2
   Destination MAC: Router3
   Source IP: Router1
   Destination IP: Router3
3) Router3 -> Router2 (ping reply)
   Source MAC: Router3
   Destination MAC: Router2
   Source IP: Router3
   Destination IP: Router1
4) Router2 -> Router1 (ping reply)
   Source MAC: Router2
   Destination MAC: Router1
   Source IP: Router3
   Destination IP: Router1

ex. See how long ARP cache last (using interface f0/0)
Router> enable
Router# show interface f0/0
Answer: "ARP Timeout 04:00:00" (default for Cisco)

Hub and Half/Full Duplex

- Hub can see all traffic on a network (including passwords on Telnet), another benefit of using a switch
- Half Duplex was first used because of Hubs and when negotiation with the other side did not work, it reverted back to 10Mbps Half Duplex
- When autonegotiation does not work, the device will also revert back to half duplex... resulting in successful pings but poor speed (transfer of large files). Frames will eventually be queued up and eventually dropped

To test Duplex mismatch or when autonegotiation does not work

1) Compare the speed of both devices (ex. router on f0/0 and computer on f0/3)
   Router1# show running interface f0/0
   "full duplex"
   Computer1# show running interface f0/3
   "full duplex"
2) Use a large # of pings (ex. 1000) and select a large datagram size (ex. 18000)
3) Result
- The device using half-duplex will have a "late collision" while performing the pings but it only occurs when you are sending enough traffic to trigger this
- The device using full-duplex, use "Router1# show interface f0/3" will see "input errors", "CRC", "runts", duplex mismatch messages 

To match duplex or autonegotiation of Switch1 and Router1

1) From Router1
   Router1# conf t
   Router1(config)# int f0
   Router1(config-if)#speed auto
   Router1(config-if)#duplex auto (or half, or full)
2) If it cannot be set at Router1, then set it on Switch1
   Switch1# conf t
   Switch1(config)# int f0
   Switch1(config-if)#speed auto
   Switch1(config-if)#duplex auto (or half, or full)
   ***MORAL of the story, set it to auto. Do not hard code.

Clear previous collisions
Router1# clear counters

Loopback interface

- 127.0.0.1
- By default, it is active (no need for "no shutdown" command)
- Loopback can be used for telnet... must setup EIGRP

Creating your own loopback interface
Router1>enable
Router1#conf terminal
Router1(config)# interface loopback 0 (up to 2147483647 - do not memorize)
Router1(config-if)# ip address anythingYouWant andGateway

Reasons to use Loopback? (Reason 1) 

- When interfaces are down between 2 routers, we can use Loopback in conjunction with EIGRP to continue access
  ex. If interface Router1 f0/0 f0/1 wants to telnet with Router2 g0/0 g0/1 and g0/0 is down, we can setup EIGRP using Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) on both devices as a backdoor access (this will use f0/1 and g0/1) through a Loopback
1) Setup Router2 loopback
   Router2#config terminal
   Router2(config)# interface loopback 0
   Router2(config-if)# ip address 2.2.2.2 255.255.252.255
2) Setup Router1 EIGRP
   Router1#config terminal
   Router1(config)# router eigrp 100
   Router1(config-router)# network 0.0.0.0
3) Setup Router2 EIGRP
   Router2#config terminal
   Router2(config)# router eigrp 100
   Router2(config-router)# network 0.0.0.0
   --Optional step #3.5-- Confirm EIGRP is working
   Router1# show ip eigrp neighbors 
   OR 
   Router1# show ip route
4) Telnet to Router2
   Router1# telnet 2.2.2.2

Reasons to use Loopback? (Reason 2) 

- Routing protocols such as OSPF use the loopback to determine Router ID in the OSPF network
1. Enable ospf on all interfaces on Router1 and place them in area 0
   
   ```
   Router1#configure terminal
   Router1(config)# router ospf
   Router1(config-router)# network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 area 0
   Router1(config-router)# end
   --Optional step-- Show ospf 
   Router1#show ip ospf interface (brief)
   ```
   
   **Router ID is selected on the highest Loopback IP address, if not, the highest IP address
   **Router's name is the Router ID. This is important because if you don't use a loopback and the Router ID was selected off a physical interface and the physical interface went down, the name of the router will change.
